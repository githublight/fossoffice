=== Auto-install normal Debian upgrades in the usuall Debian way: ===

https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades
apt-get install unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades

=== Auto-install Debian upgrades with multisign and checksums  ===

TODO
(against selective compromise of Debian server, e.g. Deian server sending malicious version of file
to some users but normal to other users = silent compromise of some compters while appearing to work
normally to other computers, reviews, admins, testers)
