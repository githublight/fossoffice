Currently we recommend Debian / Mempo primarly.

Hardened Gentoo is very interesting as well.

OpenBSD is interesting for admin's computer (possibly the documentation for that is separated out, probably most documentation here assumes linux).

* prepare debian net-install or DVD-1 (or more)
* write down (on paper) checksum of the recorded media
* possibly verify it and write+compare on another, trusted computer (best in read-only device)

* air-gap (disconnect network devices) during installation 
* install system (e.g. debian amd64)
* install mempo (or other hardened kernel)
* configure basic firewall
* turn back on the network
